# AGF Simulator

A development harness for a deterministic, event-driven AGF logistics simulator and a simple 2D replay UI.

**Public repository notice:** The source procurement specification and CAD drawings supplied for this project are marked confidential. Do not commit their files, screenshots, exact geometry, customer/site names, or derived operational details here. Keep the full project specification outside this public repository until its visibility and publication scope are approved.

## Current scope

This repository initially contains a **development harness**, not a finished logistics simulator. It establishes trace validation, AGF dispatch selection, synthetic test fixtures, agent instructions, and CI. The later UI can use Vue 3 + TypeScript + SVG; do not interpret the synthetic fixture as facility data.

## Run

Requires Node.js 22 or later. No dependency installation is necessary for the current harness.

```bash
npm test
npm run check:fixtures
npm run check
```

## Newly confirmed requirements

- The finished simulator must follow the CAD layout; the committed SVG is still a schematic, not a verified CAD reproduction.
- A settings screen must make simulation values editable, including independent per-line discharge intervals measured in minutes.
- Operators can reserve manual transport tasks 04 and 05 via UI buttons.
- Simulation results must be exportable to CSV.
- Primary AGF dispatch prioritizes eligible vehicles in the **destination/drop-off area**, then chooses the one with the lowest battery. The current simulator implements destination-area priority. Cross-area fallback is a clearly labeled scenario option rather than a confirmed site policy.

## Specifications

The ten standalone documents cover overview, equipment, normal transport 01 through 05, AGF operation, the overall 2D map, and phased AGF access/lane rules. The overview defines cross-document event, configuration, and acceptance rules. Each individual specification defines its own inputs, event sequence, state, outputs, acceptance criteria, and unresolved details.

## CAD/DXF-to-JSON map pipeline

The [DXF map pipeline guide](docs/map-dxf-pipeline.md) describes exporting the source CAD to millimetre DXF with an explicit origin, mapping layers, extracting geometry with ezdxf, supplying reviewed gates/area connectivity, and optionally rasterizing a geometric grid. The converter is [tools/dxf_to_map.py](tools/dxf_to_map.py). Run synthetic-only Python tests with `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -v` after `pip install -r requirements-map.txt`. The [private DXF inspector](tools/inspect_dxf_private.py) accepts a DXF whose unit header is unset and retains original drawing coordinates with **unverified units**. An uploaded DXF has been examined and selected CAD-native shapes extracted privately, but **mm scale, reference origin, complete block geometry and site-specific routing remain unverified**. No real CAD or derived coordinates are committed.

## DXF-free logical map

The [public-safe abstract map JSON](data/reference-logical-map.json), [schematic 2D SVG](assets/logical-map.svg), [logical map guide](docs/logical-map.md), and [conceptual path validator](src/map/logical-map.mjs) are now available. They use confirmed corridor relationships but **not measured coordinates, detailed stop/turn points or travel times**. Run `npm run check:map`. Inter-area geometry and individual warehouse slot links remain unresolved, so a physical 01–05 route engine is not yet implemented.


## Experimental interactive simulator (feature branch)

The repository includes a **scenario-driven discrete-event model** and Japanese replay UI. It is an offline, **synthetic/conceptual** simulator, not a CAD-calibrated physical or safety simulation.

Run with Node.js 22+ for tests, and serve the repository root with any static HTTP server for the UI:

    npm run check
    python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1

Then open http://localhost:8000/ . No frontend packages or build process are needed.

### Implemented simulation slice

- Four AGFs, two exclusive charger slots, scenario-configurable consumption and charging rates.
- Independent per-line minute intervals or an explicit external production event stream. Interval-generated events have inputKind=synthetic-interval, never PLC history.
- Task 01 → wrapper (input 1, process 1, output 2) → label → exit-ready → task 02 → explicitly declared synthetic warehouse slot. The same pallet ID persists across stages. Same-row task issuance is held and location reservations prevent overbooking.
- Task 03 only on observed magazine consumption down to the trigger, with an explicitly ready aligner and a +10 refill only on drop-off.
- UI-requested tasks 04/05 use preloaded synthetic temporary pallets; reentry/storage permission and individual destination must be explicitly supplied; duplicate reservations are rejected.
- Destination-area-first/lowest-battery selection, optional explicitly selected cross-area fallback (wait is the core default), independent low-battery comparison.
- Deterministic event history/snapshots, seek/replay, state panels, same-input mode comparison, and UTF-8 BOM events CSV with run/config metadata.

The UI's warehouse slots, initial AGF areas, production intervals, source supplies and journey/handling durations are **synthetic demo values**, not confirmed site settings. Travel duration inputs are modeled constants, not derived from CAD, route geometry, speed, interlocks or traffic. The displayed floor layout is a **conceptual diagram** with schematic AGF area markers, not the uploaded drawing.

### Private CAD preview with provisional millimetre assumption

The uploaded drawing has an unset DXF unit header. The user specified millimetres for this workflow, so `tools/private_cad_preview.py` supports **explicit `--assume-mm` for display only**, without claiming independently calibrated scale or physical geometry. Its private configuration requires an explicit AGF layer exclusion, including block inserts, to avoid treating drawn AGFs as equipment. The selected source layers and SVG/report must remain outside this public repository (e.g. in `private/`). The Japanese UI can load the resulting local SVG or PNG in the dedicated CAD review dialog without uploading it; schematic AGF markers are never overlaid on private CAD. The preview is not a navigable route graph. See [DXF pipeline](docs/map-dxf-pipeline.md).

### CAD point/route annotation (feature branch)

On an AGF-excluded private preview, users can click to record explicitly named pickup, drop-off, turn, gate-wait/passage, junction, home or charger points. They can then connect existing points in order as draft empty/loaded 01–05 or charge routes, and export/import the private JSON locally. SVG annotations include the user-specified millimetre CAD coordinates derived from the SVG viewBox; PNG annotations are fractional image coordinates only. Import checks the exact background SHA-256 and viewBox. No AGF locations are inferred from AGF drawing symbols, and every route is permanently marked draft, non-routable and non-ETA. Keep exported files in private storage, not this public repository.

### Not implemented or approved

Approved CAD-to-equipment registration and verified physical node/edge graph, route-dependent times, collision/traffic/shutter/interlock model, real production stream import UI, full exception recovery, runtime WCS/PLC/RCS integration, and physical charge-route timing. The map import pipeline and private inspector are intentionally separate. Only public-safe synthetic fixtures belong in this repository.


## Planned implementation

1. Confirm equipment positions and graph nodes with the user.
2. Implement discrete-event simulation with production, transport, packaging/labeling, replenishment, charging and physical occupancy.
3. Render a simplified CAD-aligned 2D SVG map. Unconfirmed routes must appear as provisional, not measured geometry.
4. Add deterministic replay, playback controls, event log, metrics, and like-for-like dispatch-mode comparison.

See the [specification index (1 overall + 9 individual documents)](docs/specification.md), [overall map specification](docs/specs/08-map.md), [DXF-free logical map](docs/logical-map.md), [DXF map pipeline guide](docs/map-dxf-pipeline.md), [AGF access and lane specification](docs/specs/09-traffic.md), [route annotation guide](docs/route-annotation-guide.md), [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [harness contract](docs/harness-contract.md), and [open decisions](docs/open-decisions.md).

The public specification includes the agreed baseline simulation settings and marks provisional values explicitly. Identifying source-document titles, original drawings, site coordinates, and operational records stay outside the repository; individual scenario values remain configurable.
## Intuitive provisional CAD route editing

After loading the private, AGF-excluded SVG/PNG preview, choose **仮線を引く** and tap a start and end point. The UI creates an explicitly unverified straight or orthogonal L-shaped draft for the selected transport 01–05/charge. Select **線を修正** to drag points, tap a segment to insert a bend point, remove a selected route point or entire route, and use undo/redo and zoom for touch devices. Existing manual point-by-point routes remain supported. Drafts are bound to the exact source image hash and SVG viewBox and can be exported/imported locally as JSON; do not commit this private output.

These are editor-generated *geometric suggestions*, not inferred passable corridors or pre-identified pickup/drop-off locations. Physical routing, AGF positions and event-engine travel times remain unchanged until a separately reviewed route/topology and explicit operating constraints are provided.

## Private initial corridor guide proposal (unassigned)

The editor now accepts **unassigned** `guide/guide` lines imported from a private, image-bound JSON draft. The working private proposal includes four explicitly provisional, editable guide strokes over the locally provided floor preview; its geometry **is not part of this public repository**. These are starting marks for human correction, not verified traversable AGF lanes or known stop points. After review, select a guide, choose task 01–05/charge and its phase, and click the explicit classification button. Classification leaves the route `draft-only`, never routable or ETA-ready.

For another private drawing, author an explicit `private/guide-seed.json` with a `guides` array of 2–200 `[u,v]` normalized points per guide (a shared junction may be written as `{"id":"JOIN","u":0.5,"v":0.5}` in several guides), then run:

```bash
node tools/build-private-route-seed.mjs --svg private/preview.svg --config private/guide-seed.json --out private/initial-guides.json
```

The script binds the draft to the exact SVG SHA-256 and viewBox, keeps guide classification unassigned and rejects output in public tracked paths. The JSON must be imported against the same SVG bytes. It does **not** infer corridors or approve a route. Do not commit the private config, preview, draft JSON or annotated screenshot.
